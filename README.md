# Loan_to_Value_Calculator
This calculator determines the loan to value of a home mortgage based on the loan amount and the appraised loan value of a property. Depending on the financial institution and the loan type,
on average the loan to value should not exceed 80%. Code runs on Python and should only use numbers and no characters when prompted to enter "loan amount" and "appraised value.
Once you receive the results multiply them by 100. For example, if it is 0.75 then multiply 0.75 x 100 = 70%
